# Employee Data Analysis and Visualization
## Project Overview
#### This project involves analyzing a companyâ€™s employee dataset using a combination of machine learning models and data visualization tools. The key steps included data preprocessing, model evaluation, and the use of Power BI for dynamic visualizations with bookmark functionality.

## Project Structure
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the employee dataset, handling missing values, duplicates, and data normalization to ensure high data quality for analysis.

**Machine Learning Evaluation:** Applied machine learning models to uncover insights such as predicting employee retention based on various factors like salary, department, and experience.

**Power BI Visualization:** Built interactive dashboards in Power BI that visualize key metrics, such as:

  1)Gender distribution
  
  2)Annual salary distribution by department
  
  3)Employee distribution by department and country
  
  4)Employee count by experience
  
  5)Countries distribution visualized on maps
  
**Power BI Bookmarks:** Integrated bookmark functionality to enhance interactivity, allowing users to switch between different dashboard 
    views smoothly.

**Documentation and Publishing:** The project process, including data preprocessing and machine learning evaluation, is documented in 
   Jupyter Notebooks. The visualized results were published using Power BI, making it easy for stakeholders to explore the data.

## How to Use

Open the Power BI report and navigate through the visualizations:
Gender distribution and salary insights
Employee breakdown by country and department
Employee experience curve
Geographic distribution on maps
Use the Bookmark Feature in Power BI to seamlessly switch between different views for more detailed analysis.

## Dependencies
Python (for Colab Notebook)

Power BI (for data visualization)

Machine Learning libraries (such as Scikit-learn)

## Installation
Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed to view the interactive reports.

Use Colab Notebook to view the preprocessing and machine learning documentation.

If running the code, ensure you have Python installed with the necessary libraries for machine learning and data preprocessing (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.).
